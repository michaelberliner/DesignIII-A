<p id="lyricOne">Before you came round my heart      would never beat much faster. Before you came round I was ready to slow down. Before you came round I was heading for a small disaster. Before you came round I was ready to blow me down. Let it go, paint my body gold, take our bodies higher and higher and higher. We can go until the morning glow. We can go higher and higher and higher. Before I was found, I felt like I could drain the ocean. Before I was found, I didn't wanna breathe out. Now my soul beats a sound, loud enough to quiet the thunder. A love with no doubt, and now I'm never gonna slow down. Let it go, paint my body gold. Take our bodies higher and higher and higher. We can go until the morning glow. We can go higher and higher and higher. Let it go, paint my body gold. Take our bodies higher and higher and higher. We can go until the morning glow. We can go higher and higher and higher. And we will walk with our feet on the ground, and we will talk with our head in the clouds, and we will walk with our feet on the ground, and we will talk with our head in the clouds, and we will walk with our feet on the ground, and we will talk with our head in the clouds, and we will walk with our feet on the ground. On the ground, on the ground, on the ground. Let it go, paint my body gold. Take our bodies higher and higher and higher. We can go until the morning glow. We can go higher and higher and higher. Let it go, paint my body gold. We can go until the morning glow. We can go higher and higher and higher. Let it go, paint my body gold. Take our bodies higher and higher and higher. We can go until the morning glow. We can go higher and higher and higher.</p>
